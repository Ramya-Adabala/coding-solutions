# Find Transition Point

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a  **sorted array, arr[]** containing only  **0s** and  **1s**, find the  **transition point**, i.e., the  **first index** where  **1** was observed, and  **before that**, only 0 was observed.  If  **arr**  does not have any  **1**, return  **-1**. If array does not have any  **0**, return  **0**.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: index 3 is the transition point where 1 begins.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, there is no "1", the answer is -1.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 0s in the array, so the transition point is 0, indicating that the first index (which contains 1) is also the first position of the array.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Index 1 is the transition point where 1 starts, and before it, only 0 was observed.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1

```java
class Solution {
    int transitionPoint(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.length;
       int l=0,h=n-1;
       int ans=-1;
       while(l<=h){
           int m=l+(h-l)/2;
           if(arr[m]==1){
               ans=m;
               h=m-1;
           }
           else
           l=m+1;
       }
       return ans;
    }
}
```
