# BFS of graph

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a  **connected undirected graph**  containing **V** vertices, represented by a 2-d adjacency list  **`adj[][]`**, where each `adj[i]` represents the list of vertices connected to vertex `i`. Perform a  **Breadth First Search (BFS)** traversal starting from vertex `0`, visiting vertices from left to right according to the given adjacency list, and return a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph.

 **Note:**  Do traverse in the  **same order**  as they are in the given  **adjacency list**.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: adj[][] = [[2, 3, 1], [0], [0, 4], [0], [2]]

Output: [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the BFS traversal will follow these steps: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 2 (first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2 
Visit 3 (next neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2, 3 
Visit 1 (next neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 2, 3, 1
Visit 4 (neighbor of 2) → Final Output: 0, 2, 3, 1, 4
```

```
Input: adj[][] = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3, 4], [2], [2]]

Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: Starting from 0, the BFS traversal proceeds as follows: 
Visit 0 → Output: 0 
Visit 1 (the first neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 1 
Visit 2 (the next neighbor of 0) → Output: 0, 1, 2 
Visit 3 (the first neighbor of 2 that hasn't been visited yet) → Output: 0, 1, 2, 3 
Visit 4 (the next neighbor of 2) → Final Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ V = adj.size() ≤ 104
0 ≤ adj[i][j] ≤ 104

         int v  = adj.size();
         Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
         ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<>();
         boolean[] vist = new boolean[v];
         q.add(0);
         vist[0]  = true;
         while(!q.isEmpty()){
             int node = q.poll();
             ans.add(node);
             for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(node).size(); i++){
                 int nei = adj.get(node).get(i);
                 if(!vist[nei]){
                     vist[nei] = true;
                     q.add(nei);
                 }
             }
         }
         return ans;
     }
 }
```
