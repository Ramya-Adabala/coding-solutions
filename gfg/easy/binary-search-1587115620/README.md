# First Occurrence in Sorted

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a sorted array  **arr[]**  and an integer  **k**, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search. If k doesn't exist in arr[] return  **-1**. 

 **Note:**  If multiple occurrences are there, please return the smallest index.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 4 appears at index 3.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], k = 445
Output: -1
Explanation: 445 is not present.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 appears at index 0.
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ 106

```java
class Solution {
    public int firstSearch(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Code Here
        int l=0,r=arr.length-1;
        int res=-1;
        while(l<=r){
            int m=(l+r)/2;
            if(arr[m]==k){
            res=m;
            r=m-1;}
            else if(arr[m]<k)
            l=m+1;
            else r=m-1;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
