# First and Last in Unosrted

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an unsorted array  **arr[]**  of integers and a  **key**  which is present in this array. Find the  **start index** (index where the element is first found from left in the array) and  **end index** (index where the element is first found from right in the array). Return an array of length 2 with elements start index and end index.

 **Note:** If the key does not exist in the array then return -1 for both start and end index.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5], key = 5
Output: [4, 5]
Explanation: 5 appears first time at index 4 and appears last time at index 5.

```

```
Input: arr = [6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2], key = 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: 4 appears first time and last time at index 2.

```

```
Input: arr = [7, 8, 6], key = 2
Output: [-1, -1]
Explanation: Since 2 does not appear in the array, we will return -1 for both the start and end indices.

```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i], key ≤ 109

```java
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> findIndex(int[] arr, int key) {
        ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = arr.length;
        int i = 0;
        int j = n - 1;

        while (i <= j) {
            if (arr[i] != key) {
                i++;
            }
            if (arr[j] != key) {
                j--;
            }
    
            if (i <= j && arr[i] == key && arr[j] == key) {
                al.add(i);
                al.add(j);
                break;
            }
        }

       
        if (al.isEmpty()) {
            al.add(-1);
            al.add(-1);
        }

        Collections.sort(al);
        return al;
    }
};
```
