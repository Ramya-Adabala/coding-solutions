# Candy

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

There are `n` children standing in a line.

Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the  **minimum**  number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= n == ratings.length <= 5 * 104
- 0 <= ratings[i] <= 5 * 104

    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }

        int totalCandies = 0;
        for (int candy : candies) {
            totalCandies += candy;
        }

        return totalCandies;
    }
}
```
