# Jump Game

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's  **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` *if you can reach the last index, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 105

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int goal = nums.length - 1;

        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i + nums[i] >= goal) {
                goal = i;
            }
        }

        return goal == 0;        
    }
}
```
