## Problem

### Worked Example - Converting Age from Int to Double

In this example, we will store a person’s age as an integer and observe how Java automatically converts it to a double when assigned to a larger data type. This process is known as implicit type conversion.

 **When executed, the code will show** :

```
Integer Age: 25  
Converted Age (Double): 25.0  

```

## Solution

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Declare and initialize an int variable
        int age = 25;

        // Step 2: Assign int value to a double variable (implicit conversion)
        double convertedAge = age;

        // Step 3: Print both values
        System.out.println("Integer Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Converted Age (double): " + convertedAge);
    }
}
```
