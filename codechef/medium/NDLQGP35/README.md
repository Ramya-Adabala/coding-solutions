## Problem

### Formatting and Merging Customer Reviews

In an e-commerce platform, customer reviews are saved as one long string where each sentence is separated by a special symbol: `","`. Your task is to:

- Split the review into individual sentences using the split() method.
- Join the sentences back together into one clean paragraph using the join() method, adding a space between them.

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Formatted Review 1: This product is amazing. Fast delivery. Highly recommended!
Formatted Review 2: Not satisfied with the packaging. The product was okay. Expected better quality.
Formatted Review 3: Great value for money. Works as expected. Will buy again.

```

  String formatted2=String.join(" ",parts2);
  
  String []parts3=rawReview3.split(",");
  String formatted3=String.join(" ",parts3);
  






        // Print the formatted reviews
        System.out.println("Formatted Review 1: " + formatted1);
        System.out.println("Formatted Review 2: " + formatted2);
        System.out.println("Formatted Review 3: " + formatted3);
    }
}
