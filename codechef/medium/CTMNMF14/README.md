## Problem

### Fuel Monitoring System

A car's fuel level must be monitored to prevent it from running too low. Your task is to store the initial fuel amount (`in liters`) and decrement it by `1` liter at each step as the car drives, ensuring the fuel is tracked accurately.

 **Steps to Complete:** 

- Initialize a double variable fuel to represent the fuel level in liters.
- Use a while loop to decrement the fuel level by 1 liter per iteration.
- The loop should stop when the fuel level reaches 1.0 liters.
- Print a message for each reduction in fuel, and alert the driver when only 1.0 liter remains.

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Fuel remaining: 7.0 liters.
Fuel remaining: 6.0 liters.
Fuel remaining: 5.0 liters.
Fuel remaining: 4.0 liters.
Fuel remaining: 3.0 liters.
Fuel remaining: 2.0 liters.
Warning! Only 1.0 liter of fuel left. Refuel soon!

```

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        double fuel = 7.0; // Initialize fuel level

        // Start while loop to monitor fuel
        while ( fuel>1.0 ) {    /* Fill in the missing condition */
            System.out.println("Fuel remaining: " + fuel + " liters.");    /* Print remaining fuel message */

            // Reduce fuel by 1.0 liter
            fuel-=1.0;    // Fill in the missing logic
        }

        // Print low fuel warning
        System.out.println("Warning! Only 1.0 liter of fuel left. Refuel soon!");  
    }
}

```
