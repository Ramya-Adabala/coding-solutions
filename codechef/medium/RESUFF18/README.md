## Problem

### Checking Voting Eligibility

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the  **ternary operator (`? :`)**  to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. This method helps in understanding  **conditional execution in Java**  using a compact syntax.

 **When executed, the code will show:** 

```
Eligible to vote

```

## Solution

**Language:** Java  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the variable 'age' with a predefined value (20)
        int age = 20; 

        
        String eligibility = (age >= 18) ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible to vote";

        // Output the eligibility result to the console
        System.out.println(eligibility);
    }
}


```
