## Problem

### Incoming Requests

In this example, we are going to demonstrate a simple simulation of a server that continuously processes incoming requests using an infinite loop in Java. The server indicates that it is operational by repeatedly displaying the message "Server is running".

**You will get a Time limit exceeded error because we have not terminated the loop.
To get AC (Accepted) in this problem, use break inside the while loop — it immediately stops the loop. We’ll discuss more about break later on.**

## Solution

**Language:** C++  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A

```cpp
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     
       // This infinite loop simulates a continuously running server.
        while(true)
        {
             System.out.println("Server is running");
             //Write break; below
             System.out.println("Server is running");
             
             
        }
    
    }
}

```
